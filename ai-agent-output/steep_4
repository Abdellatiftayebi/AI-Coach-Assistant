  "introduction": "Real Madrid is a team known for its tactical flexibility and ability to adapt to different opponents. This analysis covers their last 10 matches, focusing on their tactical approach, key players, and recent trends.",
  "profil_tactique": {
    "formations": "Real Madrid primarily utilizes a 4-3-3 formation, but variations like 4-4-2 and 4-3-1-2 are also seen depending on the opponent and game situation. Ancelotti is known to adapt the formation based on the players available and the opponent's weaknesses.",
    "style_de_jeu": "Their style of play varies between possession-based football and quick counter-attacking transitions. They aim to control possession but are also deadly on the break, especially with players like Vinicius Jr. They are known to be pragmatic, adjusting their style as needed.",
    "transitions": "Offensively, they transition quickly, utilizing the pace of their wingers and the precise passing of their midfielders. Defensively, they press high up the pitch at times but can also drop into a compact block to protect their goal. The speed of transition from defense to attack is a key strength.",
    "phases_arretees": "Real Madrid is strong in attacking set-pieces, with players like Benzema and Ramos (if available) posing aerial threats. Defensively, they can be vulnerable to well-organized set-pieces, particularly against physically strong opponents.",
    "comportement_sans_ballon": "Without the ball, Real Madrid's work rate and intensity varies. At times they press aggressively, aiming to win the ball back quickly, while at other times they conserve energy and focus on maintaining a solid defensive shape. Their pressing intensity is often dictated by the opponent's quality and the importance of the match."
